# Data Module

Deanna Summa's ProductLab Data Module Repository

This repository holds Deanna's assignments completed using SQL.

## What I Learned:
I learned about relational and non-relational databases. I learned SQL functions that allow you to create tables, input data, and pull out insights from that data. This is a very strong skill to have as a product mananger to understand metrics/data around how the product is performing.
